This is a project inspired by the odin project in which I am deconstructing and then reconstructing the google homepage.
Upon completion I have shown an understanding of the basic structure of the html format, along with an understanding of how to implement images, text boxes and buttons. 
This project also shows my basic understanding of css stylings, including the use of classes, element positioning and flexboxes.
